                <p>In Wingspan, you draw bird cards and then play them into different habitats by paying the correct amount of food and eggs. The more birds are on your board, the more food you can gain at once, and the more eggs you can lay. Some birds are worth more points, while others give you more ways of gaining resources, allowing you to play more overall birds. </p>

                </table> 
                <p>In Terraforming Mars, you play as a corporation participating in an effort to make Mars habitable for humans. You play cards and amass resources that allow you to take terraforming actions such as raising the temperature or oxygen level, or placing an ocean. Your score at the end of the game is a combination of how much you have terraformed and the value of points and resources on your cards.</p>

                        <th>Number of players</th>

                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>In Everdell, you build a woodland "city" by placing critter and construction cards into a grid. Each card has a resource cost, so you must use strategic worker placement to gain resources that allow you to play cards that in turn often give other useful resource-gaining abilities and allow you to eventually play higher-value cards with fewer effects near the end of the game.</p>
