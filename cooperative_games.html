            <p>Nemesis is a (mostly) cooperative board game where you play as a crew member of a ship traveling through deep space... with deadly aliens aboard. You and your fellow players must make sure the ship makes it to Earth with functional engines, while also working to complete individual objectives and avoid being murdered along the way. The base mechanics of the game are relatively easy to grasp, but staying alive proves much more difficult and the game often ends with 50-100% of the characters dead.</p>

            <p>Spirit Island is a completely cooperative game where you play as a nature spirit working to keep settlers from colonizing your island's shores and destroying its indigenous people. The game is assymetrical, meaning that each spirit has very different strengths and powers depending on its theming. Difficulty is scalable, and the many different spirits make each play-through unique.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Players: 1-4</li>

            <p>Too Many Bones is a cooperative battle game where you play as a 
            Gearloc, a fictional species of tinkerer-battlemongers who must fight orcs, dragons, and more en route to a final boss fight. It's a "dice-builder" game, so as you become more powerful more unique character dice become available to you and you can fight things more effectively. It's a hefty game both in terms of cost and time to play, but the theming, gameplay, and quality of components are well worth it.</p>
