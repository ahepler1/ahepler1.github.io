            <h2>Wherein I tell of my favorite board games, and advise which to play</h2>
            <p>I first learned to play complex board games as a college freshman, and subsequently dragged myself through the COVID-19 years of college by meeting up with friends to learn new games. My and my partner's collection has grown to include dozens of games of various difficulty and time required to play. Below is a list of some of my favorites!</p>
            <h2>The *best* board games:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Nemesis</li>
                <li>Spirit Island</li>
                <li>Too Many Bones</li>
                <li>Wingspan</li>
                <li>Terraforming Mars</li>
                <li>Everdell</li>
            </ol>
