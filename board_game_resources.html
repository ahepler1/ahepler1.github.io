                <h3>Board Game Cafes</h3>
                <p>One great way to try out different board games and see if you enjoy them before investing your money in purchasing them is to visit a board game cafe, of which there are several in NYC. The two most well-known are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://uncommonsnyc.com/"> The Uncommons (Greenwich Village)</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.hexnyc.com/">Hex & Co (three locations, listed below)</a>
                        <ul>
                            <li>West Side</li>
                            <li>Upper East Side</li>
                            <li>Union Square</li>
                        </ul> 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These cafes also have many board games for sale, so you have the option of purchasing a game as well!</p>

                <h3>Doing Board Game Research</h3>
                <p>My favorite online source of information about board games is <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/">BoardGameGeek</a>, a website with descriptions of thousands of board games, as well as community rating/review system so that you can see how much other people enjoy the game and how difficult it is perceived to be.</p>
